# Drivers_Fault_Classification

# Introduction 

Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS) of the Maryland State Police, Montgomery County Police, Gaithersburg Police, Rockville Police, and the Maryland-National Capital Park Police.

# Objective

* Create an efficient and reliable system that automates fault determination, ultimately contributing to road safety.
* Insurance companies for claims processing, law enforcement for assigning responsibility, and policymakers for road safety improvements. 
* Empower drivers to better understand their driving behavior and identify areas for improvement to contribute to safer roadways.

# Approach 

Build four classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Classification. These models are tailored to classify driverâ€™s at fault, ultimately providing insights into the responsible party in traffic collisions. Eventually, present the results of analysis and discuss the implications of findings, including recommendations for stakeholders.

# Results

* Enhanced Road Safety Measures: The findings highlight the potential for policy interventions in areas with a higher incidence of at-fault collisions. Law enforcement and policymakers can use this information to implement targeted safety measures, improving road safety.
* Improved Driver Awareness: By providing insights into fault determination, this system can be leveraged to enhance driver awareness of their own driving behavior. This information can help drivers identify areas for improvement and reduce accidents.

Overall, this project has not only addressed the pressing issue of fault determination but also laid the foundation for an automated system that can revolutionize accident resolution and contribute to safer roadways in Montgomery County and beyond.
